undercode.org
Undercode is a platform for developers and designers alike (more like a community), committed to providing resources (free of cost) to new developers/designers.

The undercode project is an open-sourced one, open to all developers who wish to contribute and help grow the technology ecosystem.

NB:
While this project is open-source, anyone can contribute as long as you have an intermediate knowledge of programming. React & Node is a plus but not compulsory. Database knowledge is a plus. CSS (Less/Sass) knowledge is highly appreciated but not mandatory. HTML knowledge is compulsory.

That aside, welcome to the undercode team!
